				**0x01. Python - if/else, loops, functions**

**0-positive_or_negative** - assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed.
				to print whether the number stored in the variable number is positive or negative.

**1-last_digit** - will assign a random signed number to the variable number each time it is executed 
			to print the last digit of the number stored in the variable number.

**2-print_alphabet** - a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
			using one print function, one loop, no stored variable and no imported module

**3-print_alphabt** -  a program that prints the ASCII alphabet, in lowercase, not followed by a new line.
			all letters except "q" and "e", using one print function, one loop and no stored variable

**4-print_hexa** -  a program that prints all numbers from 0 to 98 in decimal and in hexadecima
			using one print function, one loop, no stored variable and no imported module

**5-print_comb2** -  a program that prints numbers from 0 to 99. Numbers printed in ascending order, using only two print functions
			and only one loop.

**6-print_comb3** -  a program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits.
			The two digits must be different, 01 and 10 are considered the same combination of the two digits 0 and 1.
			Numbers are printed in ascending order, with two digits

**7-islower** -  a function that checks for lowercase character.

**8-uppercase** -  a function that prints a string in uppercase followed by a new line.

**9-print_last_digit** - a function that prints the last digit of a number.

**10-add** -  a function that adds two integers and returns the result.

**11-pow** -  a function that computes a to the power of b and return the value.

**12-fizzbuzz** - a function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space.
		For multiples of three print Fizz instead of the number and for multiples of five print Buzz.
		For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print FizzBuzz.
		Prototype: def fizzbuzz():

**13-insert_number** - a function in C that inserts a number into a sorted singly linked list.
			Prototype: listint_t *insert_node(listint_t **head, int number);
